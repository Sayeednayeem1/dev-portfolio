            <p>This part of me wants to learn about building web pages and learn as many as i can about web developement. So far i have been learning fluently and successfully. I think if i continue learning like i am learning now i can become a pro level developer within a year or so. But most important thing is that right now i've an ambition, a road to follow. And i will continue to run as long as i can to see the light at the end of the tunnel. You know there is nothing more beautifull to to the sunrise as the wind blow by you and just live the moment. Thats when you know that "yeah life is beautifull"<!DOCTYPE html></p>
